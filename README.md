**Problem Statement:**

In the pharmaceutical industry, efficient management of medicine supply is crucial for ensuring availability and accessibility of medicines to patients. However, traditional manual methods of managing inventory often lead to inefficiencies, errors, and delays in supply chain processes. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive Pharmacy Management System that can automate and streamline the medicine supply management process, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and timely delivery of medicines to patients.

**Project Description:**

The Pharmacy Management System is designed to address the challenges faced in offline medicine supply management by providing a robust database management system. Implemented using Python Flask and MySQL, this system offers a user-friendly interface for managing tasks related to medicine supply. It leverages the functionalities of AMPPS for efficient deployment and customization.

**Key Features:**

Medicine Inventory Management: Maintain a comprehensive database of available medicines, including details such as name, quantity, expiry date, and supplier information.
Order Management: Facilitate the ordering process by enabling users to place orders for required medicines, track order status, and manage delivery schedules.
Supplier Management: Manage supplier information, including contact details, payment terms, and purchase history, to ensure smooth procurement of medicines.
User Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure login mechanisms to authenticate users and assign appropriate access permissions based on roles (e.g., admin, pharmacist, inventory manager).
Reporting and Analytics: Generate insightful reports and analytics on medicine inventory, sales trends, and supplier performance to support data-driven decision-making.
Alerts and Notifications: Send automated alerts and notifications for low stock levels, pending orders, and upcoming expirations to prevent stockouts and minimize wastage.
Integration with Billing System: Seamlessly integrate with the billing system to update inventory levels and generate invoices for sold medicines.

**Future Enhancements:**

Online Ordering: Enable customers to place orders online through a web portal or mobile app, improving accessibility and convenience.
Barcode Scanning: Implement barcode scanning functionality to expedite the process of updating inventory and tracking medicines.
Predictive Inventory Management: Utilize advanced algorithms to predict demand, optimize stock levels, and prevent overstocking or understocking of medicines.
Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR): Integrate with EHR systems to access patient information and provide personalized medicine recommendations and dosage instructions.
Mobile Compatibility: Develop a mobile-friendly version of the application to enable on-the-go access for users such as pharmacists and inventory managers.
Automatic Reordering: Implement automatic reordering of medicines based on predefined thresholds to streamline procurement processes and ensure continuous availability of essential medicines.
